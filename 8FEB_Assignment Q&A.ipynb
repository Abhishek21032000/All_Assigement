    "      The idea behind abstraction is to present an object or a system in a way that focuses on what it does,\n",
    "        rather than how it does it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for example - Consider a car.The user of a car inly needs to know what it does(i.e ,it is a mean of\n",
    "    transportation), but not how it does it(i.e,the inrnal mechanics ,such as the engine,gears, and wheels)\n",
    "    The car;s abstract interface provides the necessary functions for the user to operate it(e.g. start the\n",

    "\n",
    " By using these concepts, we can create classes that define a common interface hide  for related objects, and hide \n",

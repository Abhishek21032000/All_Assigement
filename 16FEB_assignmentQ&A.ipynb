    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "ANS:------->\n",
    "A database is a collection of data that is organized in a structured way,\n",
    "allowing it to be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used in\n",
    "a wide range of applications, from simple record-keeping to complex data analysis and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two broad categories\n",
    "of database management systems that differ in their approach to storing and querying data.\n",
    "Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, where data is organized into \n",
    "tables with defined relationships between them. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, \n",
    "use a variety of different data models, including document-oriented, key-value, and graph models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Schema: SQL databases have a predefined schema that specifies the structure of \n",
    "each table and the relationships between them. NoSQL databases are schemaless or have \n",
    "flexible schema, which means that the structure of the data can evolve over time without\n",
    "requiring changes to the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Query language: SQL databases use the SQL language for querying data, which provides a \n",
    "standard syntax for accessing and manipulating data. NoSQL databases typically have their\n",
    "own query languages or APIs that are specific to the data model used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Scalability: SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, meaning that they can handle \n",
    "larger amounts of data by increasing the computing resources of a single server.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed to be horizontally scalable, meaning that they can handle\n",
    "larger amounts of data by adding more servers to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.ACID compliance: SQL databases are designed to be ACID-compliant, which means that\n",
    "they provide strong guarantees for data consistency, integrity, and durability. \n",
    "NoSQL databases may or may not be ACID-compliant, depending on the specific implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require a predefined schema,\n",
    "complex queries, and strong data consistency guarantees, while NoSQL databases are better for\n",
    "applications that require flexible schema, high scalability, and fast data access. \n",
    "However, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements\n",
    "of the application and the tradeoffs between the different features and benefits of each type of database."

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of DDL commands and their use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create new database objects,\n",
    "such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. For example, the following\n",
    "command creates a new table called \"customers\" with columns for \"id\", \"name\", and \"email\":\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "DROP: The DROP command is used to remove database objects, such as tables, views, indexes,\n",
    "and constraints. For example, the following command drops the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object,\n",
    "such as adding or removing columns from a table, or modifying the definition of a constraint.\n",
    "For example, the following command adds a new column called \"address\" to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN address VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "    \n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all data from a table, but does not remove \n",
    "the table itself. This is useful when you want to clear the data from a table without deleting\n",
    "the table structure. For example, the following command removes all data from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are important DDL commands used to create, modify, \n",
    "and delete database objects. These commands are used to define the structure of a database and manage \n",
    "its contents, and are essential for maintaining the integrity and performance of a database."

    "This command retrieves the \"name\" and \"email\" columns for the customer\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "ANS:----->\n",
    "In a relational database, a primary key is a column or set of columns in a table \n",
    "that uniquely identifies each row in that table. A primary key is used to enforce data\n",
    "integrity and ensure that there are no duplicate rows in a table. A foreign key, on the \n",

    "Here is an example of how primary keys and foreign keys work in a database:\n",

    "customer id, name, address, and email.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a relationship between the two tables, we would use the customer \n",
    "id column in the \"orders\" table as a foreign key that refers to the primary key of \n",

    "the foreign key, since it refers to the primary key of the \"customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using primary keys and foreign keys, we can create relationships between tables and ensure \n",
